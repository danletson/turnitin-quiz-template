# Turnitin Quiz Template
Template files for building a quiz to be hosted on turnitin.com, built with fullPage.js http://alvarotrigo.com/fullPage/


## Instructions:
- Create a quiz in Jotform 
- Hook Jotform quiz to new Google Doc
- Download individual quiz files, and populate template w/Jotform fields
- Update answers object, explanations object, and ranks object in quiz-main.js

### Notes:
- JotForm quiz source includes a bunch of extra crud we don't need (including a ton of scripts) so look at the annotated source code for hints on what needs to be populated.
